            <h3>Project</h3>
            <h2>36 Rep Max Calculator</h2>
            <p>This was my first project which included <b>HTML, CSS</b> with <b>Bootstrap, and Vanilla Javascript.</b>  I often used a 20rep max calulator during or outside of my strength training workouts to figure out my 1 rep max each time to plan my appropriate sequential weights and reps for the next workout.  This is the first website that I know of that calculates both bodyweight and external weight with reps to calculate one rep max as well as extend past 20 reps.<br><br><br>Note: This was the first website I've ever hosted.  I use it at least a few days a week and has proven to be very useful.</b></p>

            <h3>Project</h3>
            <h2>Dota 2 Roster Name Change</h2>
            <p>Dota 2 is one of my favorite PC games and at the beginning we often labeled a hero a completely different character for convinience and comedic value(eg. Crystal Maiden as Elsa from Frozen).
                I used <b>HTML, CSS, and Vanilla Javascript.</b>  I recently made a second edit due to wanting to exercise my array skills.  This time I was able to create two filter buttons representing either a carry or support characters.

            <h3>Project</h3>
            <h2>FPS Timed Target Practice</h2>
            <p>My inspiration for this project was while playing Valorant and Rainbow Six Seige on PC, especially on reactionary target practice mode. <b>HTML, CSS, and Vanilla Javascript</b> was used in this website.</p>

            <h3>Project</h3>
            <h2>NFT Project Template</h2>
            <p>I was a part of an NFT project.  I downloaded the entire Repo from Hashlips via Youtube to have access to the codes to accept Ethereum payments.  We had a web designer on our team and therefore I had to translate his designs from Dreamweaver and recreate it using <b>React</b> since that was the language.  This was my first time translating design from a designer as well as developing the visuals using <b>React.</b>  I also analyzed the code enough where I was able to create a ternary oprator that changes the text of the wallet button(top right) wether the user was signed in.  The languages I had to learn for this project was <b>HTML, CSS, React, and Solidity</b> (to understand and execute smart contracts that enable successful ETH transactions.) </p>

            <h3>Project</h3>
            <h2>Pokemon Card Generator (2nd gen)</h2>
            <p>I was looking for a project which included an API.  I modified an original project which was the first generation Pokemon via youtube.  My main change was adding 100 to the Math.random equation representing random pokemon number so that the range is 152-252 instead of 1-151.  I used <b>HTML, CSS, and vanilla Javascript</b> At some point I do plan on making a React version.</p>
